  Harry Styles is a man, a very beautiful one. His name sounds like hairstyles. He has hair. He wears custom-made Gucci, floral suits. He once was in a band called No Directions... JK he was in One Direction. He is British. Which means he is probably on the left spectrum of the political spectrum. Most of Britian is fairly socialist.</p>
